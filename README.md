MineCraftPlugins
================

This project will contain my Java progress from start to whenever the finish is. I'm hoping to learn Java through making minecraft plugins and using other tools such as Udemy. 

My tools at the moment:
Bukkit plugins for beginners by StormCoreFilms: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EUPVpqwvZw&list=PLlmh-IYCohJ931R6Yv8uNAZoZEPQj5kPR&index=1

Some notes regarding the tech stack for these plugins:
- Plugins will be made for the most recent build of minecraft. That being 1.8
- The JDK required for plugin development is 1.7
